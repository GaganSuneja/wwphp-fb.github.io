Over the years in PHP community we have noticed that many users meet similar issues and ask questions
about PHP and web development on their PHP journey. We are making an FAQ section of [international PHP group on Facebook][php-group]
with the most frequently popped up questions and issues. There are many FAQ content for PHP on the web but for the purposes
of this group's specifics this content should give you some less confusion with your PHP journey as well.
