        <p>to the Github Pages of the <strong>international PHP Facebook Group</strong>,
        the following pages will show you our rules, a qualified FAQ containing
        most asked questions from our daily discoveries on our group and an small
        overview who is representing the group as its staff.</p>
        <p>But first, keep in mind that you accept the following rules of our group if you request a membership:</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="row">
    <div class="large-12 columns">
        <h5 style="color:red"><i class="fa fa-circle-thin"></i> English, please.</h5>
        <p>
            The group language was, would be in the future and is <strong>English</strong>. We will delete topics and comments that are not localized to English. If you are not able to communicate in English <a href="http://translate.google.com">Google Translate</a> may be an option.
        </p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="row">
    <div class="large-12 columns">
        <h5 style="color:red"><i class="fa fa-circle-thin"></i> Your topic has to be web development-centric</h5>
        <p>
            You are, or will be, a member of a PHP group that allows the discussion of web development topics,
            this includes topics about PHP, embeddable, client-related or service-extending languages (including NodeJS, JavaScript, CSS), XML, XSLT, YAML and others. You should keep in mind that our group is generally a PHP group. A good mix is what we would see and what we would allow, otherwise 14 days long periods of NodeJS-discussions are not part our goals. This rule may be improved and reduced to a lower set of languages in the future, depending on how the group acts.
        </p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="row">
    <div class="large-4 columns">

        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="large-4 columns">
        <h5 style="color:red"><i class="fa fa-circle-thin"></i> be professional</strong></h5>
        <p>
            Sometimes you`ll see questions that are very easy to answer with the use of Google.
            Stay professional, stay social. Help out with a link or a short explaination or ignore the topic.
        </p>
    </div>

        </p>
